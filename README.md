# E-learning data analysis

* Preprocessed, analyzed and visualized 600+ entries of e-learning data from R package dataedu to predict students’ final grades based on survey responses & their engagement with online courses using R (ggplot2).
* Experimented with random forests (bootstrap resampling, cross-validation, tuning with different min node sizes) and linear regression for grade prediction model using tidyverse, caret, and ranger. Random forests achieved highly accurate results (R squared: 0.97, small RMSE: 4.6).
* Identified significant factors affecting grade prediction results based on overall importance: the number of each student’s discussion posts (importance: 100), subject they learned (25.96) & time they spent (12.66).
